1) To test OCL constraints you first have to generate All (open .ecore, right-click on "forms"->"Generate All")
2) Then you need to right-click the .ecore->"EPackages registration"->"Re-register E-Packages into Repository"

3) Then you need to open the .ecore, select an element->right-click->"Create Dynamic Instance"
4) In the new file you make a sample model and right-click->"Validate" to validate it.

(If you make changes you'll have to repeat steps 1) and 2) to update the model.
